					<h2>Who should I collaborate with?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="fragment">A teacher?</span></li>
						<li><span class="fragment">Multiple teachers?</span></li>
						<li><span class="fragment">Students?</span></li>
					</ul>
					<section> <!-- a single teacher -->
						<h2>A single teacher</h2>
						<p>
							This would be a good place to start.  This will allow you to get
							your feet wet, and test out the waters to see if this is something
							for you.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section> <!-- multiple teachers -->
						<h2>Multiple teachers</h2>
						<p>
							This might be a good idea to branch into in the future.  This could
							look differently depending on how you approach this idea.  You could
							have multiple teachers giving input into the creation of a single
							project.  Or, you can have multiple individiual projects going
							at the same time.  I've found the latter to be easier, but will
							again attempt the former in the future.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section> <!-- Students? -->
						<h2>Students</h2>
						<p>
							The basis of this is to create a project (or multiple projects)
							based on the requests of students in someone else's classroom. I
							have found this to be the most rewarding for both sets of students.
						</p>

				<section> <!-- What class(es) do I run this in? -->
					<h2>What class(es) do I run this project in?</h2>
					<p>I've had success in both <strong>ICS3U</strong> and <strong>ICS4U</strong></p>
					<p>For ICS3U, the students created a product for a primary school teacher for their
						mathematics class</p>
					<p>For ICS4U, each student (or group) created a product for a primary school student group</p>
					<p>More info on this later</p>

				<section> <!-- How did it turn out? -->
					<h2>How did it turn out?</h2>

					<!-- put a link to the Grade 3 project -->


					<!-- put a link to the Grade 1 project -->


					<ul>
						<span class="fragment"><li>Grade 3 project examples here</li></span>
						<span class="fragment"><li>Grade 1 project examples here</li></span>

				<section> <!-- How do I go about doing this? -->
					<h2>How do I go about doing this myself?</h2>

					<p>
					 put in information about what I did

							 then take a moment and ask what other people have done.  This will
							 be a good time to switch over to the Google Doc in order to start
							 taking notes from anyone in the audience.

							 Give the Google Doc to the audience to work with.

							 For the Google Doc, ensure that you section it off to include
							 various questions for the audience to partake in.

							 This will ensure that they have some questions to think about
							 and a path for them to think about implementation in their own
							 classroom.

							 This will chew up the remainder of the time in the lecture.
